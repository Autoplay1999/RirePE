	+ v409.2, v414.1
	+ v20x client has SendPacket Hook detection and send packet detection, it is also bypassed
+ creating private server needs to understand packet format, so this tool helps understanding packet format
+ if this PE says OK, the packet format is correct, but real server has some NG format because server and client is not good coded

## how to use
+ Run RirePE.exe and Inject Packet.dll to game client
	+ you have to remove or bypass mscrc and HackShield/xigncode/BlackCipher before injecting dll
